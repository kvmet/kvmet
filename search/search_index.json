Simple text and tag searching is (relatively) easy in relational databases and is fairly well explored. More recently, vector databases have grown in popularity for quickly searching across a large number of dimensions to find similar entities based on proximity. These kinds of databases are very useful when paired with certain types of machine learning and their effectiveness can be amplified through the use of embeddings.</p> <p>Embeddings are very useful because they can effectively reduce the number of dimensions required to represent a dataset (dimensional compression), but they have the disadvantage of not being able to freely add/remove dimensions. This property makes embeddings very useful for cases where the entire problem space is available in advance, but doesn't lend itself to cases that need \"on-the-fly\" addition or removal of dimensions. To deal with this limitation, one might choose to avoid embeddings and instead choose to preserve the higher dimensionality of the original data. All databases that I am aware of have a dimensionality limit of tens of thousands, which is impressively high but it is still easy to imagine cases where even higher limits would be useful.</p> <p>Finally, sparseness is one of the biggest properties that limits readily available vector databases. Being able to define entities without having all dimensions described and simultaneously being able to search across that data without having to provide search terms for every dimension would be valuable in many cases, but isn't an easily solveable thing.

Little did I know that I was going to spend 5 hours troubleshooting GitHub Actions scripts.</p> <p>I started by just asking GPT4 to generate a script. The first iteration didn't quite do what I wanted but I was able to tweak it to make it work. It was pretty functional but I wanted to change the formatting. I kept trying to tweak it to get it to function but I kept running into issues with the formatting not surviving the different stages of the build pipeline or other mysterious problems. Back to GPT4. I managed to get the basic formatting working for a single commit and then wanted to expand it to the full list of 10 entries. This is where I wound up losing a lot of time. No matter what I tried I wound up only being able to get the first one working. Turns out that GitHub actions doesn't make a full-depth fetch so I had to instruct it to fetch additional commits while generating the changelog. </p> <p>Here's what I wound up on for the current version of the changelog generation. I think something like <code>awk</code> would be much more robust, but after all the troubleshooting I decided to just make it as simple and direct as possible to keep it easy:</p> <pre><code>- name: Update Changelog\n  run: |\n\u00a0 \u00a0 git fetch --depth 11 origin main\n\u00a0 \u00a0 cat docs/CHANGELOG\\_TEMPLATE.md &gt; docs/CHANGELOG.md\n\u00a0 \u00a0 git log -n 10 --pretty=format:'---%n%n## %s%n%n%ad%n%n Commit: \\[%h]\\(https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/commit/%H)%n%n\\*\\*Changed Files:\\*\\*%n' --name-status | sed 's/$/\u00a0 /' &gt;&gt; docs/CHANGELOG.md\n</code></pre> <p>Why is fetch depth 11 when only 10 commits are displayed?</p> <p>The oldest fetched commit will show all files as changing since it is the sum of all prior commits. Fetching one extra commit ensures that the 10th one will only show files that were updated in that commit.</p> <p>That's pretty much it.

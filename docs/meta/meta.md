# How this site works

The content of this site is written almost exclusively in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and converted into a static website using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/).
Its source is available via [GitHub](https://github.com/kvmet/kvmet/actions) and the static website is hosted using GitHub Pages.

When an update is pushed to the `main` branch of this site's git repo, an [Action](https://github.com/kvmet/kvmet/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml) is run that builds the site and deploys it to the `gh-pages` branch. That branch is then served directly via GitHub Pages.

## Additional Plugins

- **Math Rendering:** [KaTeX](https://katex.org/)

## Acceptable

I wouldn't feel bad about skipping these, although they might still be a good experience. Consider watching them anyway.

- Kiki's Delivery Service
  - Some people love this movie. It isn't for me.
- Speed Racer
  - It's fine. I first saw it in IMAX which was a fun experience, but I started to watch it another time at home and didn't enjoy it as much.

## Mediocre

I wouldn't bother unless you just want to see them or think that it appeals to you. If a friend says it's their favorite movie, give it a fair shake.

- It Follows

## Bad

Avoid.

- [The Expendables](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1320253/) (2010)
   - Pointless. Hard to track, not because it is complex but because it is so uninteresting that I just wanted it to be over. I can't believe there are so many movies in this series.
- [King Kong](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360717/) (2005)
   - I walked out of the theater. Perhaps I should give it another shot, but it is over three hours long. After watching an hour of the movie with nothing happening, my friends and I decided we didn't care to finish it.
- [Sixteen Candles](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088128/) (1984)
   - A lot of people seem to enjoy this movie and it shows up on many recommendation lists, but I had a hard time watching due to so many elements that are no longer culturally acceptable. Couldn't finish.

# First-aid Kit

## Wound Care

  - **Adhesive Bandages**: Band-aid
    - Not really necessary since they can be easily made from other components in the kit, but they are more aesthetically pleasing and easy enough to carry that they are worth having.
  - **Wound Wash**: Hibiclens
    - Much better and safer for cleaning wounds than other alternatives. It is also has the appropriate pH to not cause pain.
  - **Styptic Fluid**: 
    - Stops bleeding on small and medium sized cuts.
  - **Tourniquet**: 
    - Stabilize and reduce blood loss for large wounds.
  - **Paper Tape**: Generic
    - Can be used to fashion bandages with gauze. Mostly I use it for protecting broken callouses, blisters, or tears in skin.
  - **Cyanoacrylate (CA) Glue**: Superglue
    - Generally nice to have. Can be used to cover small, annoying cuts. Also a good stand-in for 1-2 stitches for larger cuts.

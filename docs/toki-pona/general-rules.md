# General Rules
- Questions to ask occasionally
    - What do I have too much of in my life?
    - What am I missing in my life?

- Continually improve the things within your control. It's all you _can_ do.
    - There's no benefit to losing sleep over the problems in the world. Do everything within your power and find some closure in knowing that you improved your slice of the universe.

- Spatial Organization
    - Everything needs a home & address
    - Only stack identical items
    - Everything should be accessible with one hand if possible
    - Find organizational tools that work for you
        - Labels
    - Kit things and keep the kit together
    - Don't allow kipple to accumulate
        - "Kipple is useless objects, like junk mail or match folders after you use the last match or gum wrappers or yesterday's homeopape. When nobody's around, kipple reproduces itself. For instance, if you go to bed leaving any kipple around your apartment, when you wake up the next morning there's twice as much of it. It always gets more and more."
        - "No one can win against kipple," \[Isidore\] said, "except temporarily and maybe in one spot, like in my apartment I've sort of created a stasis between the pressure of kipple and nonkipple, for the time being. But eventually I'll die or go away, and then the kipple will again take over."

- Digital Organization
- On making things
    - Safety above all else
    - It must work
    - Solve the problems you have
    - Don't waste time on impossible problems
        - Dont use solutions that are orthogonal to the root cause. (e.g. you can outprogram physics)
    - The right way should be the easiest way
    - Write things down
    - You are not alone
    - Use the right tool
    - Simple is better. Don't be too clever
    - Leave no trace
    - Production Time > Setup Time > Design Time
    - Do not optimize too early. Start with the simplest and most naive approach.
- Life in general
    - For most, success only comes with steady accumulation.
        - Modified version of a quote from Endeavor in My Hero Academia
        - "What is better - to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort" -Paarthurnax (Skyrim)
    - You must be your own agent for change
    - Bodies are weird
    - Every problem has an elegant solution, but it's not always the one you should use
        - "When I am working on a problem, I never think about beauty but when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong." - R. Buckminster Fuller
        - “Engineers like to solve problems. If there are no problems handily available, they will create their own problems.” - Scott Adams
    - Everyone is their own protagonist
        - “We judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their behavior.” - Stephen M.R. Covey
        - “To know all is to forgive all.” - Germaine de Staël

<!-- Ranking Thoughts

1.  **Masterpiece** - Reserved for movies that are widely regarded as exceptional in every aspect: storytelling, acting, cinematography, score, and impact. These are the films that define genres, change the industry, and endure through time.
2.  **Outstanding** - These are excellent movies that may have minor flaws but still deliver a high-quality cinematic experience. They are memorable, well-crafted, and would be recommended without hesitation.
3.  **Solid** - Films that are enjoyable and well-made but lack the distinctive qualities that would elevate them to Outstanding or Masterpiece status. They are competent across the board but may not resonate as deeply or have as lasting an impact.
4.  **Mediocre** - These films are passable but unremarkable. They might have significant issues in key areas like script, performance, or direction, and while they are watchable, they do not stand out in any meaningful way.
5.  **Poor** - Reserved for movies that are flawed on multiple levels. They are often characterized by weak plots, poor acting, numerous technical issues, and generally fail to provide an engaging experience. These films are typically not recommended except perhaps for a lesson in what not to do in filmmaking.


## Outstanding
**Extraordinary:** Reserved for films that are not only innovative and exceptionally executed but also pivotal within the industry, often setting new benchmarks and leaving a significant cultural impact.

**Outstanding:** Must-watch. These films deliver superior quality and artistry with a level of innovation and execution that approaches the pinnacle of cinematic achievement, positioning them just shy of extraordinary.

**Great:** Highly recommended. Films in this category are distinguished by a strong fusion of craft and entertainment. They display notable skill in storytelling and technical aspects, providing an engaging and memorable viewing experience.

## Decent

Optionally recommended. Average and has appeal to certain audiences or in a specific context (i.e. only good in a theater). If it piques your interest or comes recommended, give it a chance.

- Clockstoppers
    - Largely forgettable but it had some cute concepts.
    - ??? quote "Spoiler"
        The scene with the bees being stopped mid-air is pretty memorable for me. Also the frozen paintballs.
- The Conjuring
    - Watched because it was a friend's favorite. Not my favorite but it had some good qualities.
- The Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy
- Kiki's Delivery Service
    - Some people love this movie. It isn't for me. I'd take the time to watch if you like other Miyazaki works.
- The Killer (2023)
    - It felt to me that it was trying to be a lot deeper than it actually was. The main hand-to-hand fight scene was incredible though.
    - ??? quote "Spoiler"
        Okay but c'mon, the premise of the movie is that the guy is bad at his job? If only we could all be so lucky to retire after our first mistake at our jobs. He incessantly talks about his "rules" while in the process of breaking them. Annoying.
- Speed Racer
    - It's fine. I first saw it in IMAX which was a fun experience, but I started to watch it another time at home and didn't enjoy it as much.
- Turbo Kid
    - Very unique style. Very gory and cheesy. It's not trying to be an incredible film and largely accomplishes what it set out to do.
- Wild Wild West
    - Giant mechanical spider! Otherwise, nothing to telegraph home about.
- Young Frankenstein
    - Some of the humor doesn't hold up to modern tastes. That said, it also is quite quotable and original in many aspects. Consider watching if you like other movies involving the same people.
- [Zoolander 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1608290/) (2016)
    - It's hard to recreate the magic of the original. Falls flat but still coaxed a few laughs out of me.

## Mediocre

Not recommended. Below average and unlikely to be a rewarding experience. Proceed with modest expectations.

- The Hangover
- The Happening
    - This movie changed directors halfway through and you can really feel it. The payoff is pretty poorly constructed despite the interesting premise.
- It Follows
    - Watched this soon after it came out at the recommendation of several friends. I didn't really enjoy it it all and thought the main premise felt very lame and forced.
- [King Kong](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360717/) (2005)
    - I walked out of the theater. Perhaps I should give it another shot, but it is over three hours long. After watching an hour of the movie with nothing happening, my friends and I decided we didn't care to finish it.

## Bad

Avoid. Fail to deliver on most accounts and are generally not worth your time.

- [The Expendables](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1320253/) (2010)
    - Pointless. Hard to track, not because it is complex but because it is so uninteresting that I just wanted it to be over. I can't believe there are so many movies in this series.
- [Sixteen Candles](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088128/) (1984)
    - A lot of people seem to enjoy this movie and it shows up on many recommendation lists, but I had a hard time watching due to so many elements that are no longer culturally acceptable. Couldn't finish.
